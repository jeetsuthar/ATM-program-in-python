# ATM-program-in-python
In this 4th Semester DSA mini project, I've developed an ATM machine using Python. The program utilizes file handling concepts and incorporates additional functionalities such as cash withdrawal, cash deposit, PIN change, and displaying account details. Through file handling, user account data is securely stored and managed, ensuring persistence and security. With a focus on user experience and error handling, the program provides a seamless and reliable banking solution.
